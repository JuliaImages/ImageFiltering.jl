Manipulating an image in the frequency domain amounts to retaining or discarding particular frequency components—a process analogous to sifting or filtering [1].  Because the Fourier transform establishes a link between the spatial and frequency representation of an image, one can interpret various image manipulations in the spatial domain as filtering operations which accept or reject specific frequencies.\n\nThe phrase spatial filtering is often used to emphasise that an operation is, at least conceptually, devised in the context of the spatial domain of an image. One further distinguishes between linear and non-linear spatial filtering. A filter is called linear if the operation performed on the pixels is linear, and is labeled non-linear otherwise.\n\nAn image filter can be represented by a function\n\n w sin mathbbZ mid -k_1 le s le k_1   times  t in mathbbZ mid -k_2 le t le k_2     rightarrow mathbbR\n\nwhere k_i  in mathbbN (i = 1,2). It is common to define k_1 = 2a+1 and k_2 = 2b + 1, where a and b are integers, which ensures that the filter dimensions are of odd size. Typically, k_1 equals k_2 and so, dropping the subscripts, one speaks of a k times k filter. Since the domain of the filter represents a grid of spatial coordinates, the filter is often called a mask and is visualized as a grid. For example, a 3 times 3 mask can be potrayed as follows:\n\nscriptsize\nbeginmatrix\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(-1-1) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(-10) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n \nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(-11) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(0-1) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(00) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n \nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(01) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(1-1) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(10) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n \nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(11) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\nendmatrix\n\nThe values of w(st) are referred to as filter coefficients.\n\nDiscrete convolution versus correlation\n\nThere are two fundamental and closely related operations that one regularly performs on an image with a filter. The operations are called discrete correlation and convolution.\n\nThe correlation operation, denoted by the symbol star,  is given in two dimensions by the expression\n\nbeginaligned\ng(xy) = w(xy) star f(xy) = sum_s = -a^a sum_t=-b^b w(st) f(x+s y+t)\nendaligned\n\nwhereas the comparable convolution operation, denoted by the symbol ast, is given in two dimensions by\n\nbeginaligned\nh(xy) = w(xy) ast f(xy) = sum_s = -a^a sum_t=-b^b w(st) f(x-s y-t)\nendaligned\n\nSince a digital image is of finite extent, both of these operations are undefined at the borders of the image. In particular, for an image of size M times N, the function f(x pm s y pm t) is only defined for 1 le x pm s le N and 1 le y pm t le M. In practice one addresses this problem by artificially expanding the domain of the image. For example, one can pad the image with zeros. Other padding strategies are possible, and they are discussed in more detail in the Options section of this documentation.\n\nOne-dimensional illustration\n\nThe difference between correlation and convolution is best understood with recourse to a one-dimensional example  adapted from [1]. Suppose that a filter w-101rightarrow mathbbR has coefficients\n\nbeginmatrix\nboxed1  boxed2  boxed3\nendmatrix\n\nConsider a discrete unit impulse function f x in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   rightarrow 01  that has been padded with zeros. The function can be visualised as an image\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\n0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed1  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  0\nendmatrix\n\nThe correlation operation can be interpreted as sliding w along the image and computing the sum of products at each location. For example,\n\nbeginmatrix\n0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0 \n1  2  3         \n 1  2  3         \n  1  2  3        \n   1  2  3       \n    1  2  3      \n     1  2  3    \n      1  2  3\nendmatrix\n\nyields the output g x in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   rightarrow mathbbR, which when visualized as a digital image, is equal to\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nboxed0  boxed0  boxed3  boxed2  boxed1  boxed0  boxed0\nendmatrix\n\nThe interpretation of the convolution operation is analogous to correlation, except that the filter w has been rotated by 180 degrees. In particular,\n\nbeginmatrix\n0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0 \n3  2  1         \n 3  2  1         \n  3  2  1        \n   3  2  1       \n    3  2  1      \n     3  2  1    \n      3  2  1\nendmatrix\n\nyields the output h x in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   rightarrow mathbbR equal to\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nboxed0  boxed0  boxed1  boxed2  boxed3  boxed0  boxed0\nendmatrix\n\nInstead of rotating the filter mask, one could instead rotate f and still obtained the same convolution result. In fact, the conventional notation for convolution indicates that f is flipped and not w. If w is symmetric, then convolution and correlation give the same outcome.\n\nTwo-dimensional illustration\n\nFor a two-dimensional example, suppose the filter w-1 0 1 times  -101 rightarrow mathbbR  has coefficients\n\n beginmatrix\n boxed1  boxed2  boxed3  \n boxed4  boxed5  boxed6  \n boxed7  boxed8  boxed9\n endmatrix\n\nand consider a two-dimensional discrete unit impulse function\n\n fx in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   times  y in mathbbZ mid 1 le y le 7  rightarrow  01\n\nthat has been padded with zeros:\n\n boxed\n beginmatrix\n   0         0          0          0           0          0     0   \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0   \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed1   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0         0          0          0           0          0     0\n endmatrix\n\nThe correlation operation w(xy) star f(xy)  yields the output\n\n boxed\n beginmatrix\n boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  \n boxed0   boxed9  boxed8  boxed7  boxed0  \n boxed0   boxed6  boxed5  boxed4  boxed0  \n boxed0   boxed3  boxed2  boxed1  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0  boxed0\n endmatrix\n\nwhereas the convolution operation w(xy) ast f(xy) produces\n\n boxed\n beginmatrix\n boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed1  boxed2  boxed3  boxed0 \n boxed0  boxed4  boxed5  boxed6  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed7  boxed8  boxed9  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0\n endmatrix\n\nDiscrete convolution and correlation as matrix multiplication\n\nDiscrete convolution and correlation operations can also be formulated as a matrix multiplication, where one of the inputs is converted to a Toeplitz matrix, and the other is represented as a column vector. For example, consider a function fx in mathbbN mid 1 le x le M  rightarrow mathbbR and a filter w s in mathbbN mid  -k_1 le s le k_1   rightarrow mathbbR. Then the matrix multiplication\n\nbeginbmatrix\nw(-k_1) \t  0\t     ldots\t 0\t\t    0\t\t\t\nvdots \t w(-k_1) \t ldots\t vdots   0\t        \nw(k_1) \t     vdots    ldots\t 0\t\t    vdots    \n0 \t    \t w(k_1)\t ldots    w(-k_1)   0\t\t    \n0 \t         0\t\t     ldots\t vdots   w(-k_1)\t\nvdots      vdots\t ldots\t w(k_1)    vdots\t\n0            0          0\t\t\t 0\t\t    w(k_1)\nendbmatrix\nbeginbmatrix\nf(1) \nf(2) \nf(3) \nvdots \nf(M)\nendbmatrix\n\nis equivalent to the convolution w(s) ast f(x) assuming that the border of f(x) has been padded with zeros.\n\nTo represent multidimensional convolution as matrix multiplication one reshapes the multidimensional arrays into column vectors and proceeds in an analogous manner. Naturally, the result of the matrix multiplication will need to be reshaped into an appropriate multidimensional array.\n\nOptions\n\nThe following subsections describe valid options for the function arguments in more detail.\n\nChoices for r\n\nYou can dispatch to different implementations by passing in a resource r as defined by the ComputationalResources package. For example,\n\n    imfilter(ArrayFireLibs(), img, kernel)\n\nwould request that the computation be performed on the GPU using the ArrayFire libraries.\n\nChoices for T\n\nOptionally, you can control the element type of the output image by passing in a type T as the first argument.\n\nChoices for img\n\nYou can specify a one, two or multidimensional array defining your image.\n\nChoices for kernel\n\nThe kernel[0,0,..] parameter corresponds to the origin (zero displacement) of the kernel; you can use centered to place the origin at the array center, or use the OffsetArrays package to set kernel's indices manually. For example, to filter with a random centered 3x3 kernel, you could use either of the following:\n\nkernel = centered(rand(3,3))\nkernel = OffsetArray(rand(3,3), -1:1, -1:1)\n\nThe kernel parameter can be specified as an array or as a \"factored kernel\", a tuple (filt1, filt2, ...) of filters to apply along each axis of the image. In cases where you know your kernel is separable, this format can speed processing. Each of these should have the same dimensionality as the image itself, and be shaped in a manner that indicates the filtering axis, e.g., a 3x1 filter for filtering the first dimension and a 1x3 filter for filtering the second dimension. In two dimensions, any kernel passed as a single matrix is checked for separability; if you want to eliminate that check, pass the kernel as a single-element tuple, (kernel,).\n\nChoices for border\n\nAt the image edge, border is used to specify the padding which will be used to extrapolate the image beyond its original bounds. As an indicative example of each option the results of the padding are illustrated on an image consisting of a row of six pixels which are specified alphabetically: boxeda  b  c  d  e  f. We show the effects of padding only on the left and right border, but analogous consequences hold for the top and bottom border.\n\n\"replicate\" (default)\n\nThe border pixels extend beyond the image boundaries.\n\nboxed\nbeginarraylcr\n  a a a a    a  b  c  d  e  f  f  f  f  f\nendarray\n\n\nSee also: Pad, padarray, Inner, NA  and NoPad\n\n\"circular\"\n\nThe border pixels wrap around. For instance, indexing beyond the left border returns values starting from the right border.\n\nboxed\nbeginarraylcr\n  c d e f    a  b  c  d  e  f  a  b  c  d\nendarray\n\n\nSee also: Pad, padarray, Inner, NA  and NoPad\n\n\"reflect\"\n\nThe border pixels reflect relative to a position between pixels. That is, the border pixel is omitted when mirroring.\n\nboxed\nbeginarraylcr\n  e d c b    a  b  c  d  e  f  e  d  c  b\nendarray\n\n\nSee also: Pad, padarray, Inner, NA  and NoPad\n\n\"symmetric\"\n\nThe border pixels reflect relative to the edge itself.\n\nboxed\nbeginarraylcr\n  d c b a    a  b  c  d  e  f  f  e  d  c\nendarray\n\n\nSee also: Pad, padarray, Inner, NA  and NoPad\n\nFill(m)\n\nThe border pixels are filled with a specified value m.\n\nboxed\nbeginarraylcr\n  m m m m    a  b  c  d  e  f  m  m  m  m\nendarray\n\n\nSee also: Pad, padarray, Inner, NA  and NoPad\n\nInner()\n\nIndicate that edges are to be discarded in filtering, only the interior of the result is to be returned.\n\nSee also: Pad, padarray, Inner, NA  and NoPad\n\nNA()\n\nChoose filtering using \"NA\" (Not Available) boundary conditions. This is most appropriate for filters that have only positive weights, such as blurring filters.\n\nSee also: Pad, padarray, Inner, NA  and NoPad\n\nChoices for alg\n\nThe alg parameter allows you to choose the particular algorithm: FIR() (finite impulse response, aka traditional digital filtering) or FFT() (Fourier-based filtering). If no choice is specified, one will be chosen based on the size of the image and kernel in a way that strives to deliver good performance. Alternatively you can use a custom filter type, like KernelFactors.IIRGaussian.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following subsections highlight some common use cases.\n\nConvolution versus correlation\n\n\n# Create a two-dimensional discrete unit impulse function.\nf = fill(0,(9,9));\nf[5,5] = 1;\n\n# Specify a filter coefficient mask and set the center of the mask as the origin.\nw = centered([1 2 3; 4 5 6 ; 7 8 9]);\n\n#=\n The default operation of `imfilter` is correlation.

Alteratively, explicitly provide the indices inds of imgfilt that you want to calculate, and use NoPad boundary conditions. In such cases, you are responsible for supplying appropriate padding: img must be indexable for all of the locations needed for calculating the output.

The gradient points in the direction of maximum rate of change of f_textrmA at the coordinates (x_1x_2). The gradient can be used to compute the derivative of a function in an arbitrary direction. In particular, the derivative of f_textrmA in the direction of a unit vector mathbfu is given by nabla_mathbfuf_textrmA(x_1x_2) = nabla mathbff_textrmA(x_1x_2) cdot mathbfu, where cdot denotes the dot product.\n\nDigital image\n\nIn practice, we acquire a digital image f_textrmD(x_1x_2) where the light intensity is known only at a discrete set of locations. This means that the required partial derivatives are undefined and need to be approximated using discrete difference formulae [1].\n\nA straightforward way to approximate the partial derivatives is to use central-difference formulae\n\n fracpartial f_textrmD(x_1x_2)partial x_1  approx\n        fracf_textrmD(x_1+1x_2) - f_textrmD(x_1-1x_2) 2\n\nand\n\n fracpartial f_textrmD(x_1x_2)partial x_2   approx\n         fracf_textrmD(x_1x_2+1) - f_textrmD(x_1x_2-1)2\n\nHowever, the central-difference formulae are very sensitive to noise. When working with noisy image data, one can obtain a better approximation of the partial derivatives by using a suitable weighted combination of the neighboring image intensities. The weighted combination can be represented as a discrete convolution operation between the image and a kernel which characterizes the requisite weights. In particular, if h_x_d (d = 12) represents a 2r+1 times 2r+1 kernel, then\n\n fracpartial f_textrmD(x_1x_2)partial x_d  approx\nsum_i = -r^r sum_j = -r^r\nf_textrmD(x_1-ix_2-j)\n  h_x_d(ij)\n\nThe kernel is frequently also called a mask or convolution matrix.\n\nWeighting schemes and approximation error\n\nThe choice of weights determines the magnitude of the approximation error and whether the finite-difference scheme is isotropic. A finite-difference scheme is isotropic if the approximation error does not depend on the orientation of the coordinate system and anisotropic if the approximation error has a directional bias [2]. With a continuous analogue image the magnitude of the gradient would be invariant upon rotation of the coordinate system, but in practice one cannot obtain perfect isotropy with a finite set of discrete points. Hence a finite-difference scheme is typically considered isotropic if the leading error term in the approximation does not have preferred directions.\n\nMost finite-difference schemes that are used in image processing are based on 3 times 3 kernels, and as noted by [7], many can also be parametrized by a single parameter alpha as follows:\n\nmathbfH_x_1 =\nfrac14 + 2alpha\nbeginbmatrix\n-1  -alpha  -1 \n0  0  0 \n 1  alpha  1\nendbmatrix\nquad\ntextand\nquad\nmathbfH_x_2 =\nfrac12 + 4alpha\nbeginbmatrix\n-1  0  1 \n-alpha  0  alpha \n -1  0  1\nendbmatrix\n\nwhere\n\nalpha =\nbegincases\n0   textSimple Finite Difference \n1   textPrewitt \n2   textSobel \n24351   textAndo \nfrac103   textScharr \n4   textBickley\nendcases\n\nSeparable kernel\n\nA kernel is called separable if it can be expressed as the convolution of two one-dimensional filters. With a matrix representation of the kernel, separability means that the kernel matrix can be written as an outer product of two vectors. Separable kernels offer computational advantages since instead of performing a two-dimensional convolution one can perform a sequence of one-dimensional convolutions.\n\nOptions\n\nYou can specify your choice of the finite-difference scheme via the kernelfun parameter. You can also indicate how to deal with the pixels on the border of the image with the border parameter.\n\nChoices for kernelfun\n\nIn general kernelfun can be any function which satisfies the following interface:\n\n    kernelfun(extended::NTuple{N,Bool}, d) -> kern_d,\n\nwhere kern_d is the kernel for producing the derivative with respect to the dth dimension of an N-dimensional array. The parameter extended[i] is true if the image is of size > 1 along dimension i. The parameter kern_d may be provided as a dense or factored kernel, with factored representations recommended when the kernel is separable.\n\nSome valid kernelfun options are described below.\n\nKernelFactors.prewitt\n\nWith the prewit option [3] the computation of the gradient is based on the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  = frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  -1  -1 \n    0  0  0 \n    1  1  1\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  =  frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1 \n    -1  0  1 \n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix \n = frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    1 \n    1  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix\n\n = frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    1  1  1\n    endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also: KernelFactors.prewitt and Kernel.prewitt\n\nKernelFactors.sobel\n\nThe sobel option [4] designates the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  -2  -1 \n     0  0  0 \n     1  2  1\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1 \n    -2  0  2 \n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix \n = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    1  2  1\n    endbmatrix\n\n = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    1 \n    2  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.sobel and Kernel.sobel\n\nKernelFactors.ando3\n\nThe ando3 option [5] specifies the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1   =\n    beginbmatrix\n    -0112737  -0274526  -0112737 \n     0  0  0 \n     0112737  0274526  0112737\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2   =\n    beginbmatrix\n    -0112737  0  0112737 \n    -0274526  0  0274526 \n    -0112737  0  0112737\n    endbmatrix \n  = beginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    0112737  0274526  0112737\n    endbmatrix\n\n  = beginbmatrix\n    0112737 \n    0274526  \n    0112737\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.ando3, and Kernel.ando3;  KernelFactors.ando4, and Kernel.ando4; KernelFactors.ando5, and Kernel.ando5\n\nKernelFactors.scharr\n\nThe scharr option [6] designates the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  =\nfrac132\nbeginbmatrix\n-3  -10  -3 \n0  0  0 \n 3  10  3\nendbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  =\nfrac132\nbeginbmatrix\n-3  0  3 \n-10  0  10\n-3  0  3\nendbmatrix \n = frac132\nbeginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\nendbmatrix\nbeginbmatrix\n    3  10  3\nendbmatrix\n\n = frac132\nbeginbmatrix\n    3 \n    10  \n    3\nendbmatrix\nbeginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\nendbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.scharr and Kernel.scharr\n\nKernelFactors.bickley\n\nThe bickley option [7,8] designates the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  = frac112\n    beginbmatrix\n        -1  -4  -1 \n         0  0  0 \n         1  4  1\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  = frac112\n    beginbmatrix\n        -1  0  1 \n        -4  0  4 \n        -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix \n = frac112\n    beginbmatrix\n        -1 \n        0  \n        1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n        1  4  1\n    endbmatrix\n\n  = frac112\n   beginbmatrix\n        1 \n        4  \n        1\n   endbmatrix\n   beginbmatrix\n        -1  0  1\n   endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.bickley and Kernel.bickley\n\nChoices for border\n\nAt the image edge, border is used to specify the padding which will be used to extrapolate the image beyond its original bounds.

For example, mapwindow(median!, img, window) returns an Array of values similar to img (median-filtered, of course), whereas mapwindow(extrema, img, window) returns an Array of (min,max) tuples over a window of size window centered on each point of img.\n\nThe function f receives a buffer buf for the window of data surrounding the current point. If window is specified as a Dims-tuple (tuple-of-integers), then all the integers must be odd and the window is centered around the current image point. For example, if window=(3,3), then f will receive an Array buf corresponding to offsets (-1:1, -1:1) from the imgf[i,j] for which this is currently being computed. Alternatively, window can be a tuple of AbstractUnitRanges, in which case the specified ranges are used for buf; this allows you to use asymmetric windows if needed.\n\nborder specifies how the edges of img should be handled; see imfilter for details.\n\nFinally indices allows to omit unnecessary computations, if you want to do things like mapwindow on a subimage, or a strided variant of mapwindow. It works as follows:\n\nmapwindow(f, img, window, indices=(2:5, 1:2:7)) == mapwindow(f,img,window)[2:5, 1:2:7]\n\nExcept more efficiently because it omits computation of the unused values.\n\nBecause the data in the buffer buf that is received by f is copied from img, and the buffer's memory is reused, f should not return references to buf. This\n\nf = buf->copy(buf) # as opposed to f = buf->buf\nmapwindow(f, img, window, indices=(2:5, 1:2:7))\n\nwould work as expected.\n\nFor functions that can only take AbstractVector inputs, you might have to first specialize default_shape:\n\nf = v->quantile(v, 0.75)\nImageFiltering.MapWindow.default_shape(::typeof(f)) = vec\n\nand then mapwindow(f, img, (m,n)) should filter at the 75th quantile.\n\nSee also: imfilter.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"function_reference/#ImageFiltering.MapWindow.mapwindow!","page":"Function reference","title":"ImageFiltering.MapWindow.mapwindow!","text":"mapwindow!(f, out, img, window; border=\"replicate\", indices=axes(img))\n\nVariant of mapwindow, with preallocated output.
