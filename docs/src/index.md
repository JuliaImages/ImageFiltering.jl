# ImageFiltering.jl

ImageFiltering supports linear and nonlinear filtering operations on
arrays, with an emphasis on the kinds of operations used in image
processing. The core function is `imfilter`, and common kernels
(filters) are organized in the `Kernel` and `KernelFactors` modules.

## Demonstration

Let's start with a simple example of linear filtering:

```julia
julia> using ImageFiltering, TestImages

julia> img = testimage("mandrill");

julia> imgg = imfilter(img, Kernel.gaussian(3));

julia> imgl = imfilter(img, Kernel.Laplacian());
```

When displayed, these three images look like this:

The most commonly used function for filtering is [`imfilter`](@ref).

## Linear filtering: noteworthy features

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using Colors, ImageFiltering, TestImages
    img = testimage("mandrill")
end
```

### Correlation, not convolution

ImageFiltering uses the following formula to calculate the filtered
image `F` from an input image `A` and kernel `K`:

```math
F[I] = \sum_J A[I+J] K[J]
```

Consequently, the resulting image is the correlation, not convolution,
of the input and the kernel. If you want the convolution, first call
[`reflect`](@ref) on the kernel.

### Kernel indices

ImageFiltering exploits a feature introduced into Julia 0.5, the
ability to define arrays whose indices span an arbitrary range:

```julia
julia> Kernel.gaussian(1)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,2,Array{Float64,2}} with indices -2:2×-2:2:
 0.00296902  0.0133062  0.0219382  0.0133062  0.00296902
 0.0133062   0.0596343  0.0983203  0.0596343  0.0133062
 0.0219382   0.0983203  0.162103   0.0983203  0.0219382
 0.0133062   0.0596343  0.0983203  0.0596343  0.0133062
 0.00296902  0.0133062  0.0219382  0.0133062  0.00296902
```

The indices of this array span the range `-2:2` along each axis, and
the center of the gaussian is at position `[0,0]`.  As a consequence,
this filter "blurs" but does not "shift" the image; were the center
instead at, say, `[3,3]`, the filtered image would be shifted by 3
pixels downward and to the right compared to the original.

The `centered` function is a handy utility for converting an ordinary
array to one that has coordinates `[0,0,...]` at its center position:

```julia
julia> centered([1 0 1; 0 1 0; 1 0 1])
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}} with indices -1:1×-1:1:
 1  0  1
 0  1  0
 1  0  1
```

See [OffsetArrays](https://github.com/alsam/OffsetArrays.jl) for more information.

### Factored kernels

A key feature of Gaussian kernels---along with many other
commonly-used kernels---is that they are *separable*, meaning that
`K[j_1,j_2,...]` can be written as ``K_1[j_1] K_2[j_2] \cdots``.
As a consequence, the correlation

```math
F[i_1,i_2] = \sum_{j_1,j_2} A[i_1+j_1,i_2+j_2] K[j_1,j_2]
```

can be written

```math
F[i_1,i_2] = \sum_{j_2} \left(\sum_{j_1} A[i_1+j_1,i_2+j_2] K_1[j_1]\right) K_2[j_2]
```

If the kernel is of size `m×n`, then the upper version line requires `mn`
operations for each point of `filtered`, whereas the lower version
requires `m+n` operations. Especially when `m` and `n` are larger,
this can result in a substantial savings.

To enable efficient computation for separable kernels, `imfilter`
accepts a tuple of kernels, filtering the image by each
sequentially. You can either supply `m×1` and `1×n` filters directly,
or (somewhat more efficiently) call [`kernelfactors`](@ref) on a
tuple-of-vectors:


```julia
julia> kern1 = centered([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,1,Array{Float64,1}} with indices -1:1:
 0.333333
 0.333333
 0.333333

julia> kernf = kernelfactors((kern1, kern1))
(ImageFiltering.KernelFactors.ReshapedOneD{Float64,2,0,OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,1,Array{Float64,1}}}([0.333333,0.333333,0.333333]),ImageFiltering.KernelFactors.ReshapedOneD{Float64,2,1,OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,1,Array{Float64,1}}}([0.333333,0.333333,0.333333]))

julia> kernp = broadcast(*, kernf...)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,2,Array{Float64,2}} with indices -1:1×-1:1:
 0.111111  0.111111  0.111111
 0.111111  0.111111  0.111111
 0.111111  0.111111  0.111111

julia> imfilter(img, kernf) ≈ imfilter(img, kernp)
true
```

If the kernel is a two dimensional array, `imfilter` will attempt to
factor it; if successful, it will use the separable algorithm. You can
prevent this automatic factorization by passing the kernel as a tuple,
e.g., as `(kernp,)`.

### Popular kernels in Kernel and KernelFactors modules

The two modules [`Kernel`](@ref) and [`KernelFactors`](@ref) implement popular
correlation kernels in "dense" and "factored" forms, respectively. Type
`?Kernel` or `?KernelFactors` at the REPL to see which kernels are supported.

A common task in image processing and computer vision is computing
image *gradients* (derivatives), for which there is the dedicated
function [`imgradients`](@ref).

### Automatic choice of FIR or FFT

For linear filtering with a finite-impulse response filtering, one can
either choose a direct algorithm or one based on the fast Fourier
transform (FFT).  By default, this choice is made based on kernel
size. You can manually specify the algorithm using [`Algorithm.FFT()`](@ref)
or [`Algorithm.FIR()`](@ref).

### Multithreading

If you launch Julia with `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=n` (where `n > 1`), then
FIR filtering will by default use multiple threads.  You can control
the algorithm by specifying a *resource* as defined by
[ComputationalResources](https://github.com/timholy/ComputationalResources.jl).
For example, `imfilter(CPU1(Algorithm.FIR()), img, ...)` would force
the computation to be single-threaded.

## Arbitrary operations over sliding windows

This package also exports [`mapwindow`](@ref), which allows you to
pass an arbitrary function to operate on the values within a sliding
window.

`mapwindow` has optimized implementations for some functions
(currently, `extrema`).
